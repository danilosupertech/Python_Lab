# Study Lab Repository

Welcome to my Study Lab repository! This is a personal collection of programming exercises and projects I've been working on as part of my learning journey.

## About

This repository focuses primarily on **C** and **Python** programming languages.  
My goal is to create a structured and didactic environment to help myself and others learn and practice coding concepts step-by-step.

## Repository Structure

### C
Contains various C programs and executables, covering fundamental concepts such as:
- Format specifiers
- Logical operators
- Relational operators
- Simple calculators
- Temperature conversion

### Python
A collection of Python scripts and modules focusing on a wide range of topics including but not limited to:
- Magic Methods
- File handling
- Progress bars with exception handling
- List comprehensions
- Type hinting and typing concepts
- Numeric computations and algorithms
- Custom utilities and examples

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the files and run the programs.  
Each file is intended to be a small, self-contained example or exercise that demonstrates a specific programming concept.  
I aim to keep the code as clear and didactic as possible to facilitate learning.

## Contributions

This is a personal study repository, but if you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
